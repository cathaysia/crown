Most of the code is derived from **Go**, with parts adapted from **LibTomCrypto**

## Features

* **API-first design**: clean and intuitive, minimal boilerplate
* **First-class documentation**: comprehensive guides, examples, and references to get you started quickly
* **Cross-compilation friendly**:
  * Uses `asm!()` inline assembly and runtime feature detection
  * No dependency on platform-specific toolchains (except for CUDA)
* **`no_std` support**: works in embedded and bare-metal environments. (in plan)
* **Modern cryptographic primitives**: symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing, AEAD
